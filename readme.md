# 4k Data Collection Mobile

Mobile client to gather 4k data on the mission field! Yay lets save the world.

Built on top of [Emberjs](http://emberjs.com/) and kept under control with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). Will be integrated with Phonegap later on for native iOS builds! :yum:

## Get started

- Make sure mr. [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) is installed
